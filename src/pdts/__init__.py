"""pdts: probabilistic damage tolerance analysis.

Monte Carlo fatigue crack growth with variance reduction, inspection
planning against POD curves, sensitivity analysis and material basis
values. Units throughout: stress in MPa, stress intensity in MPa*sqrt(m),
crack sizes in metres, life in cycles.
